# Module 1: Web Design

## Setting up for this module and the class in general
We will work with open source software so there are lots of options. The students at Purdue are going to use different software than what I suggest. So, while I suggest something here, feel free to experiment with other packages. I just may not be able to fully support other alternatives. I have and work on both a Mac and a PC, so cross platform compatibility is big for me.
### Suggested Software
- GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/)
- VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

VS Code extensions:
- Python (should include Jupyter)
- HTML CSS Support (may not be necessary)

You also need to install Git Commandline tools. GitHub Desktop can run without them, but you need them for Git support in VS Code or other editors.

**Installing Git**

Any operating system:
Go to: https://git-scm.com/download

MacOS:
May already be installed. To check type 'git version' in the terminal window. (There is an application called terminal on your Mac. Just search for it and open it to type a command.) If you have git, you will get a version number. If you don't, it will likely ask to install developer tools. This will give you the Apple version of git. You can get the standard version at the website above.

## Lecture Notes

Source code for the slides is in this folder. Clone the directory and open the .html files locally to review slides:

*Hint: Pressing ESC when on a slide other than slide 1 opens a zoomed out view where you can quickly scroll through the slides. You may need to open in Chrome or Firefox for full compatibility. I have had issues in Safari.*

- Lecture 1.1 [in-person]:  
   - Additionally, watch the following videos before doing the quiz.
      - Watch in detail the CS50 video on HTML and CSS: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/0/
      - Skim through the CS50 video on Git: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/1/
- Lecture 1.2 [in-person]: 
- Lecture 1.3 [in-person]: Austin Toombs guest lecture. 
- Lecture 1.4 [in-person]: 

## Homework

Instructions for the Homework, including submission instructions, can be found inside the HW sub-folders. Navigate to "HW1.1" to begin the homework for Module 1, Week 1. Make sure you watch the videos prior to trying to complete the homework.

**Homework 1 is due: 9/7/2021** Make sure you complete both Homework 1.1 and Homework 1.2 before submission.

**Academic Integrity Reminder:** Make sure your lab Github repositories are "private" for the duration of the course, to prevent others from simply copying your code. I trust that you will work independently, and will evaluate your work based on your "commit" history (i.e., you should NOT just commit the ENTIRE lab 5 minutes before the deadline). In general, writing code with the help of the internet is permissable, i.e., you can ask questions on Stack Overflow, discuss the problems with each other on Slack. Ultimately, I have a policy in which I trust that you are doing the right thing, unless I see evidence to the contrary.

## Quiz

The quiz for this module is available via Canvas. 

**Quiz 1 is due: 8/27/2021**
