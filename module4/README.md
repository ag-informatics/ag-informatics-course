- Lecture 4.1 [in-person]: www.aginformaticslab.org/ag-informatics-course/module4/Lecture4.1.html. Please note I'm giving this lecture a week early since I'm out of town on Oct 3!
  - Follow along with the CS50 video on SQL, Models, and Migrations: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/4/
  - Note, the video comes with accompanying notes that you can refer to instead: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/notes/4/
- Lecture 4.2 [video]: Instead of in-person lecture on Oct 5, watch this video to learn more about how a research farm in the UK, Rothamstead Research uses a range of tools, from github to FarmOS to manage their agricultural research proejcts and data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa32Ll3DPj8 
- Lecture 4.3 [no class]: Oct 10 is October Break.
- Lecture 4.4 [in-person]: NOTE A QUICK SWITCH:
    - Oct 12 (lecture time): will be lab time instead
    - Oct 13 (lab time): FIELD TRIP TO ACRE!
 
## Labs

Instructions for the Labs, including submission instructions, can be found inside the lab sub-folders.

Lab this week is on the lighter side so that you have time to work on your project.

Academic Integrity Reminder: Make sure your lab Github repositories are "private" for the duration of the course, to prevent others from simply copying your code. I trust that you will work independently, and will evaluate your work based on your "commit" history (i.e., you should NOT just commit the ENTIRE lab 5 minutes before the deadline). In general, writing code with the help of the internet is permissable, i.e., you can ask questions on Stack Overflow, discuss the problems with each other on Slack. Ultimately, I have a policy in which I trust that you are doing the right thing, unless I see evidence to the contrary.
