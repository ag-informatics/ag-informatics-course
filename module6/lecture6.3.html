            def fieldToPaths(boundary, w_row, start_AB=None):
    """Converts a area into a set of paths of a given width.

    This function uses parallel paths to completely cover the area
    represented by the boundary. It does not consider sub-field
    decomposition, turn travel time or other more optimal field
    path generation techniques. The output is a set of paths. The
    paths are themselves rectangles. They may extend beyond the
    field boundary to ensure complete field coverage. Each path
    will be represented by a line that extends between the
    midpoints of the path rectangle edges that are of width, w_row.
    This line is the travel path of the vehicle. In turn, these lines
    will be represented by the Cartesian coordinates of the endpoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundary : np.array
        [[x0, x1, x2, x3,...]

    start_AB : np.array (optional)
        [[x0, x1]

          <p>Tractors must drive until the entire implement clears the field area instead (like below).</p>
