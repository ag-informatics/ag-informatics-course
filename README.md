<!-- Course Syllabus -->

# Introduction to Agricultural Informatics

We will overview current and emerging technologies used in digital agriculture. You will be engaged in learning technology fundamentals (languages, concepts, methods), through seven 2-week projects. These hands-on exercises will allow you to gain a practical understanding of the technology itself, review research and development trends, and debate opportunities and challenges presented by each technology. This course will equip you with basic computational thinking and software development skills for Agricultural Informatics careers.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of informatics challenges in food and agricultural systems.
2. Develop programming skills to create scripts and web applications to explore, store, manipulate, and view food and agriculture data.
3. Develop computational thinking skills to select appropriate informatics approaches and digital technologies to solve a range of challenges in food and agricultural systems.
4. Conceptualize an informatics solution to solving an open food system or agricultural challenge.

# Course Communications
**Course Materials:** This github repository will contain links to all slides, labs, etc. I will release each module's content one or two weeks at a time.

**Course Discussion:** Join the course slack channel to chat with the instructors and students at both Purdue & Uni of Kentucky, where the course is being co-taught. [**Join the Slack Channel**](https://join.slack.com/t/learn-ag-informatics/shared_invite/zt-tnsofjro-QbFiz2j4k2C_1MbwxEZrQA)

**Student Consultations:** Make appointments with me via email or slack.

## Purdue Instructor: Ankita Raturi
**Slack:** Contact @sudokita via Slack direct message for quick general discussion about the course. If it's a question/comment others can benefit from, consider using the more general channels. I will try to respond within 1 working day to Slack messages. We cannot discuss grades, personal matters, and so on via Slack due to [FERPA policies](https://slack.com/trust/compliance/ferpa-compliance). If in doubt, contact me via email/in-person.

**Email:** Contact **ankita@purdue.edu** with the email subject: **[ASM 591 AGINF]** for better indexing. Reserve use of email for long and/or complex communications. I will try to respond to email within 2 working days.

**Office:** ABE Building, Room 4031K. For in-person consultations, make an appointment first. In case we can't meet in person, we will use WebEx for a video-call meeting, as agreed upon via email. I willy try to provide in-person appointments within 2 working days of your request.

## Purdue Logistics
**Lectures:** ABE 1164. Tuesdays & Thursdays @ 9.30am - 10.20am. These will be recorded and made available online if possible. 

**Labs:** ABE 2098. Thursdays, 1.30pm - 3.20pm. If you have a scheduling conflict, I expect you to complete the labs in your own time.

# Course Structure & Schedule
This course is divided into eight 2 week modules. Each module is structured approximately as follows:

- **Week 1:**
  - **Lecture 1 - Ankita:** introduces the topic of the module. This will be discussion-based synchronous lecture. 
  - **Lecture 2 - Ankita and Video(s):** introduces the skills required for the module. Includes supplementary link(s) to video(s) that you can watch in your own time.
  - **Lab Part 1:** apply the introductory skills and concepts learned in week 1.
  - **Quiz:** quick knowledge evaluation in the form of short, multiple choice questions via Brightspace.
- Week 2:
  - **Lecture 3 - Ankita:** bookend the module with a discussion/demonstration of how the skills/concepts apply to problems in food and agriculture systems. Time permitting, includes supplementary topics (e.g., privacy, open source) and case studies (e.g., small farms, cover crops). 
  - **Lecture 4 - Guest:** this will typically be a guest lecture. Depending on the guest's availability, it may be swapped with lecture 3. These will typically give you insight into how the module topic is practices in industry or research.
  - **Lab Part 2:** building on the previous lab, you will apply the skills/concepts in the context of food and agricultural data/challenges.

  The full course schedule is described below. If you click on each module, you will see details on the lectures, labs, and the quiz.

## Course Assessments

**Quizzes** will be available on Brightspace the Monday before they are due. They 7 quizzes, due every 2 weeks. The quiz will automatically close at 5pm, Fridays, on the due dates listed below. Quizzes are multiple choice/short answer, and will be auto graded. These are intended to serve as "participation" checks, and hopefully help you evaluate how you're coping with the course. 

**Labs** will be available on Github every Monday. Each lab is due at the start of the next 2 week module. Each lab will come with submission instructions, but I will generally expect a timestamp of no later than 5pm the day it is due. There will be a 5 hour no-penalty grace period in case you have technical difficulties with submission. <!-- **Grading Note:** There are 8 labs in total. You can either do all 8 and I'll drop the lowest grade, skip one with no grade penalty (since I only count 7). Labs are graded based on your ability to demonstrate successful completion of the lab. There will be instructions for each lab (e.g., submit a screenshot and your code). --> 

The first part of the **Project** description and submission instructions will be available on 09/21/2021. Each of the three parts will be evaluated based on a high-level rubric to be provided with the project description, with more detail released as we progress through the parts. 

The **Exam** will consist of a mix of short and essay style questions. More detail will be shared later in the semester.

**Late Policy:** You can have three "late days" where you submit work a day late with no questions asked. You can use these for quizzes, labs, and projects part 1 & 2. After that, you will be penalised 5% per day late. *The moment you have any issues, please contact me, and we can discuss options.*

# Support & Policies

## Attendance Policy
This course is designed in a hybrid model, with some face-to-face meetings and others completed remotely. University policy states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. For the purposes of this course, being “present” means participating in-person or remotely as described in the course structure and completing work assigned for days when we do not meet face-to-face. This work is required to help you meet the course learning outcomes. These times count toward the course contact hours and your course grade. 

That said, this has been a complicated year, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns with attending classes in-person. Guidance on class attendance related to COVID-19 are outlined in the [Protect Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/) for Fall 2021 on the Protect Purdue website. 

## Academic Guidance in the Event of Quarantine/Isolation
Your health and safety is important. If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. 

## Accessibility
Purdue University is committed to making learning experiences accessible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are welcome to let me know so that we can discuss options. You are also encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center at: drc@purdue.edu or by phone: 765-494-1247.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling 765-494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. More details are available on our course Brightspace table of contents, under University Policies.

Make sure your lab Github repositories are "private" for the duration of the course, to prevent others from simply copying your code. I trust that you will work independently, and will evaluate your work based on your "commit" history (i.e., you should NOT just commit the ENTIRE lab 5 minutes before the deadline). In general, writing code with the help of the internet is permissable, i.e., you can ask questions on Stack Overflow, discuss the problems with each other on Slack. Ultimately, I have a policy in which I trust that you are doing the right thing, unless I see evidence to the contrary.

## Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community which recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her potential. In pursuit of its goal of academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity. The University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life. A hyperlink to Purdue’s full Nondiscrimination Policy Statement is included in our course Brightspace under University Policies.
