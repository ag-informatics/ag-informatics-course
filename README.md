# Introduction to Agricultural Informatics

We will overview current and emerging digital technologies with applications in agriculture, environment, and food systems. This course is a gentle introduction computing concepts to students across the College of Agriculture and beyond. Prospective students are expected to have a minimal computing and/or programming background, and those with no programming background should contact the instructor for guidance. Through 2-week modules involving hands-on course activities, you will incrementally learn user-centered technology design skills, computational thinking skills to evaluate, design, conceptualize, and implement informatics solutions to data-driven challenges. You will gain programming skills in current data science and web development technology stacks (Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Django), and design an informatics solution to problem in their own area of interest. This course supports professional development for students in pursuit of careers in digital product design or data-driven research.

The audience for this course is undergraduate and graduate students looking to gain experience with digital technologies. This course is _not_ just for students who eventually want to become domain-specific data scientists or software developers but is meant **to provide digital novices with a gentle on-ramp to learn digital agriculture skills so that they can better understand how technology works and is built**. By the end of this course, students should have both the vocabulary and experience to be able to identify more advance courses across the university for in-depth learning.

This course has been taken by students interested in digital agriculture and data science related minors and certificate programs. It can also be substituted to meet meet data, technology or elective requirements common to current programs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Demonstrate core skills in user-centered technology design, exploratory data analysis, and programming for the web.
2. Formulate a data science problem and implement a data science solution through collecting, integrating, analyzing, and synthesizing publicly available data.
3. Critique and experiment with informatics approaches to solving data-driven challenges in disciplines related agriculture, environment, and food systems
4. Design and develop a web application through application of new knowledge on data modeling, user interface design, and programming.
5. Design and conceptualize a novel informatics solution, applying design thinking and computational skills, to solve an open problem related to agriculture, environment, and food systems.

# Support & Policies

## Grading Scale

In this class, grades reflect the sum of your achievement of learning outcomes throughout the semester. You will accumulate points as described in the assignments portion above, with each assignment graded according to a rubric. At the end of the semester, final grades will be calculated by adding the total points earned and translating those numbers into grades based on the following percentage brackets:

| Letter | Percentage      |
| ------ | --------------- |
| A+     | 97 and above    |
| A      | 94 to 96.99     |
| A-     | 90 to 93.99     |
| B+     | 87 to 89.99     |
| B      | 84.00 to 86.99  |
| B-     | 80.00 to 83.99  |
| C+     | 77.00 to 79.99  |
| C      | 74.00 to 76.99  |
| C-     | 70.00 to 73.99  |
| D+     | 67.00 to 69.99  |
| D      | 64.00 to 66.99  |
| D-     | 60.00 to 63.99  |
| F      | 59.00 and below |

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling 765-494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. More details are available on our course Brightspace under University Policies and Statements.

Make sure your lab Github repositories are "private" for the duration of the course, to prevent others from simply copying your code. I trust that you will work independently, and will evaluate your work based on your "commit" history (i.e., you should NOT just commit the ENTIRE lab 5 minutes before the deadline). In general, writing code with the help of the internet is permissible, i.e., you can ask questions on Stack Overflow, discuss the problems with each other on Slack. Ultimately, I have a policy in which I trust that you are doing the right thing, unless I see evidence to the contrary.

## Accessibility

Purdue University strives to make learning experiences accessible to all participants. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are welcome to let me know so that we can discuss options. You are also encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center at: drc@purdue.edu or by phone at 765-494-1247. Learn more at at the [DRC website](https://www.purdue.edu/drc/index.php).

## Attendance Policy

This course follows the University Academic Regulations regarding class attendance, which state that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. I will not take attendance. We may sometimes meet remotely if (a) we have a guest speaker that is presenting virtually or (b) in case of instructor inability to provide in-person lecture due to illness, travel, or personal conflicts. You can likewise request remote attendance of a lecture, and if possible, we will make accommodations. When conflicts or absences can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, you should inform me of the situation as far in advance as possible. For unanticipated or emergency absences when advance notification to is not possible, contact me as soon as possible by email or phone. For absences that do not fall under excused absence regulations (see below), this course follows the following procedures:

1. Do not come to class if you are feeling ill, but DO email me at ankita@purdue.edu, with the subject line: "Class absence". I do not need details about your symptoms. Just let me know you are feeling ill and cannot come to class. If it is an emergency situation, please follow the University regulations on emergent medical care (see below).
2. Unless it falls under the University excused absence regulations (see below), any work due should be submitted on time via our course Brightspace.
3. If that day's class involves assessed work such as a presentation, you and I will plan if and how you can make up the work, following the assignment guidelines. This plan must be done before the next class period, so again, email me immediately when you know that you will miss class.
4. The most important consideration in any absence is how it will affect your achievement of the assignment objectives and the course learning outcomes.

For cases that fall under excused absence regulations, you or your representative should contact or go to the [Office of the Dean of Students (ODOS)](https://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absence-policies.html) to complete appropriate forms for instructor notification. Under academic regulations, excused absences may be granted by ODOS for cases of grief/bereavement, military service, jury duty, parenting leave, or emergent medical care. The processes are detailed, so plan ahead.

That said, life is complicated, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns.

<!-- ## Academic Guidance in the Event of Quarantine/Isolation
Your health and safety is important. If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. For COVID-19 concerns, please see the [Fall 2022: What you need to know guidance published July 27](https://protect.purdue.edu/updates/fall-2022-what-you-need-to-know/). If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation.  -->

## Basic Needs Security

Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. There is no appointment needed and Student Support Services is available to serve students 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

## Emergency Preparation
